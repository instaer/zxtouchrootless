# ZXTouch Rootless

**iOS 15–16 Rootless (Dopamine / NathanLR) + Roothide port by [Epic0001](https://github.com/Epic0001/zxtouchrootless)**

A **system wide** touch event simulation library for iOS. Simulate touches, run scripts, and automate your device — system level, no app injection required.

> Forked from [IOS13-SimulateTouch](https://github.com/xuan32546/IOS13-SimulateTouch) by xuan32546. This fork adds full **iOS 15–16 rootless (Dopamine, NathanLR) and roothide (Serotonin)** support.

## Current Revival Status

This fork has been actively revived for modern rootless jailbreaks. Recent releases add:

- Modernized Scripts, Settings, and floating panel UI
- Separate visual treatment for Python scripts, raw scripts, folders, readmes, and normal files
- Bundled example scripts installed under `/var/mobile/Library/ZXTouch/scripts/examples/`
- Script registry installed at `/var/mobile/Library/ZXTouch/config/tweak/script_registry.plist`
- Automatic `README.md` preview inside script folders
- Native `prompt_input(...)` support for Python scripts
- Built-in Activator-style automation triggers
- Easier script selection for trigger actions, without manually pasting `.bdl` paths
- Hardened Python runtime setup for fresh installs, including better fallback paths and visible script error diagnostics
- Floating panel script settings now persist correctly, and turning them off runs scripts once without leaking old repeat values
- Built-in recording editor for raw recordings, with timeline editing and action insertion
- Token-protected remote dashboard for scripts, recording, logs, assets, and live device status
- Persistent dashboard hosting through SpringBoard, so closing the ZXTouch app does not stop the server
- Package installs now finish before respringing, preventing interrupted dpkg transactions in Sileo
- Touch Indicator now follows each app's exact supported orientation mask, including landscape-only apps
- Stopping a Python script now terminates its complete process group without leaving a runaway shell or logger
- Script execution logging — every script start/stop/error is written to daily rolling logs under `/var/mobile/Library/ZXTouch/logs/` (3-day retention)
- Major stability fixes: socket command framing (TCP packet merging/splitting), connection FD leaks, start/stop race conditions in recording and playback, memory-safety bounds checks on touch events
- Fixed the recording editor crash when tapping Save or Cancel in a timeline item's edit alert
- No more "Script Finished" popup after a run — script completion is recorded in the execution logs instead

The built-in automation system currently supports assigning actions to Volume Up, Volume Down, and Home button click patterns. Each trigger can use 1-5 clicks and can run one of these actions:

- Smart Toggle
- Toggle Panel
- Stop Script
- Toggle Recording
- Run Script

## Tested Compatibility

| Jailbreak | iOS Version | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Dopamine (rootless) | 16.4.1, 16.6.1 | ✅ Working |
| NathanLR (rootless, semi-untethered) | 16.5.1 – 16.6.1 | ✅ Working (install `_rootless.deb`) |
| Roothide / Serotonin | 15.8, 16.6.1 | ✅ Working |

---

## What's New in This Fork

- **iOS 15–16 rootless (Dopamine)** — installs under `/var/jb/`, compatible with ElleKit
- **Roothide / Serotonin support** — native `iphoneos-arm64e` build with proper dynamic path resolution
- **image_match now working** — reimplemented using `Accelerate.framework` (no OpenCV required, zero added size)
- **iOS Shortcuts integration** — all ZXTouch actions available as Shortcuts actions
- **Rebuilt panel UI** — floating script panel with ⚙️ settings popup (repeat / speed / interval), dark mode, orientation-aware layout
- **Dark mode** — toggle in the app for both the app UI and the panel
- **Touch indicator coordinates toggle** — show or hide (x, y) labels per finger
- **Python scripts fully working** - auto-detects Procursus Python 3.8–3.12, prefers versioned interpreters over the generic `python3` symlink (routes around broken installs), copies the `zxtouch` module to every installed Python's site-packages, and reports real tracebacks in logs
- **Color picker & color searcher re-enabled** — reimplemented in pure CoreGraphics
- **OCR** working via Vision framework
- **Volume-down stop** working for Python scripts
- **Refreshed script browser and settings UI** — modern icons, cleaner grouping, README previews, and separate handling for Python/raw scripts
- **Built-in automation triggers** — assign button click patterns to panel, recording, stop, or run-script actions
- **Native script prompts** — Python scripts can request user input with `prompt_input(...)`
- **Panel playback settings fixed** - the panel remembers whether settings mode is enabled and disabling it clears repeat/speed leakage for direct play
- **Recording editor** - tap a raw recording bundle to edit, reorder, duplicate, delete, save, and test its actions
- **Persistent remote dashboard** - control ZXTouch from another device on the same Wi-Fi, even while the app is closed
- **Modern dashboard workspaces** - focused Scripts, Assets, Logs, and Device views with responsive phone and desktop layouts
- **Orientation-aware Touch Indicator** - stays within the foreground app's supported portrait or landscape orientations and maps both landscape directions correctly
- **Reliable script stopping** - tracks each Python run as a process group and stops its interpreter, shell, logger, and child processes together
- **Script execution logs** - every play (raw or Python) is logged with start/stop/error events, script path, type, repeat count, and speed; files roll daily and are kept for 3 days under `/var/mobile/Library/ZXTouch/logs/`
- **Hardened socket server and clients** - proper `\r\n` command framing fixes commands lost to TCP packet merging; per-connection queues keep one slow client from blocking others; leak-free connection handling for long-running sessions; the Python client now takes a configurable timeout instead of hanging forever on an unresponsive device

## Requirements

### Dopamine (rootless)
- iOS 15.0 – 16.6.1
- [Dopamine](https://ellekit.space/dopamine/) jailbreak
- **Python 3 (Procursus) is required** for `.py` scripts. Install via Sileo → search `python3`. ZXTouch no longer ships a bundled runtime — the old bundled `python3.7` aborted at dyld load on rootless because its libpython dylib pointed at a `/usr/lib` path that doesn't exist there.

### NathanLR (rootless, iOS 16.5.1 – 16.6.1)
- Semi-untethered — reopen the [NathanLR](https://www.nathanlr.com/) app after each reboot to reactivate tweaks
- Install the `_rootless.deb` (NathanLR uses the rootless bootstrap under `/var/jb`, not roothide)
- **Python 3 (Procursus) is required** — same as Dopamine

### Roothide / Serotonin
- iOS 15.0 – 16.6.1
- [Serotonin](https://github.com/roothide/Serotonin) or roothide-compatible jailbreak
- **Python 3 (Procursus) is required** for `.py` scripts. Install via Sileo → search `python3`.

---

## Installation

### Through GitHub Releases:
1. Download the latest `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/Epic0001/zxtouchrootless/releases)
   - `*_rootless.deb` → Dopamine
   - `*_roothide.deb` → Roothide / Serotonin
2. Install via Filza or SSH:
```sh
dpkg -i <file>.deb && killall -9 SpringBoard
```

### Through GitHub Actions (latest build):
1. Go to [Actions](https://github.com/Epic0001/zxtouchrootless/actions)
2. Open the latest successful run
3. Download the `ZXTouch-rootless-deb` or `ZXTouch-roothide-deb` artifact

---

## Usage

After installation the tweak listens on **port 6000**. Send commands in the defined format from any language. The Python client is provided for convenience.

### Panel (Volume Button)
Double-click **volume down** to open/close the panel.
- Tap a script to run it immediately
- Enable **⚙️** first to set repeat count, speed, and interval before running
- **⏺ REC** — start recording touches
- **⏹ STOP** — stop a running script
- Settings → **Dark Mode** to toggle dark theme on app and panel

### Scripts and Examples

Example scripts are installed automatically with the `.deb` under:

```text
/var/mobile/Library/ZXTouch/scripts/examples/
```

The app keeps a script registry at:

```text
/var/mobile/Library/ZXTouch/config/tweak/script_registry.plist
```

The registry helps the app display script metadata, icons, README previews, and script selections for automation actions.

### Recording Editor

Tap a `.bdl` bundle whose entry file is a raw recording to open its timeline editor. From there you can:

- Tap a step to edit its coordinates, delay, toast text, app identifier, or raw command
- Reorder steps in edit mode
- Swipe a step to duplicate it, or delete unwanted steps
- Insert a tap, swipe, wait, toast, or app launch
- Save the recording and play the edited result immediately

### Remote Dashboard

Enable **Settings -> Web Server** and tap the dashboard URL row to copy the private address. Open that address from a phone, tablet, or computer on the same Wi-Fi network.

The dashboard includes four focused workspaces:

- **Scripts:** search and filter the library, run or stop scripts, download entries, and control recording
- **Assets:** upload files such as image-matching templates directly into a selected script bundle
- **Logs:** follow, filter, copy, export, or clear runtime output
- **Device:** inspect live service, display, orientation, battery, foreground app, and server diagnostics

The URL contains a private access token. Do not share it outside your local network. Dashboard hosting runs inside SpringBoard, so it remains available when the ZXTouch app is closed.

### Automation Triggers

Open **Settings → Automation** in the app to assign actions to button click patterns. Current trigger sources are:

- Volume Up
- Volume Down
- Home Button

Each trigger can be set to 1-5 clicks and can run Smart Toggle, Toggle Panel, Stop Script, Toggle Recording, or a selected `.bdl` script.

### Script Execution Logs

Every script run (from the app, the panel, the dashboard, the socket API, or an automation trigger) is logged to a daily file:

```text
/var/mobile/Library/ZXTouch/logs/script-YYYYMMDD.log
```

Each line carries a timestamp and an event tag:

```text
2026-08-25 15:32:05 [START] script: /var/mobile/.../demo.bdl | type: RAW | repeat: 0 | speed: 1.0
2026-08-25 15:32:07 [END] script finished (raw): /var/mobile/.../demo.bdl
2026-08-25 15:40:11 [ERROR] script exited with code 1 (py): /var/mobile/.../check.bdl | output: /var/mobile/Library/ZXTouch/coreutils/ScriptRuntime/output
```

- `START` / `END` — a run began / finished normally (each replay pass logs its own pair)
- `STOP` — the run was stopped by the user
- `ERROR` — the script could not run or exited non-zero; for Python failures the line points at the output file containing the traceback

Log files are kept for **3 days** and purged automatically on each write.

## Documentation (Python)

### Installation

**On your iOS device:** The ZXTouch Python module is installed automatically with the `.deb`.

**On a computer (remote control):** Copy the `zxtouch` folder from [`layout/usr/share/zxtouch/python`](layout/usr/share/zxtouch/python) to your Python `site-packages` directory.

### Create a ZXTouch Instance

```python
from zxtouch.client import zxtouch
device = zxtouch("127.0.0.1")  # use device IP for remote control
```

The constructor accepts an optional socket timeout (seconds, default 60):

```python
device = zxtouch("192.168.1.5", timeout=120)
```

If the device does not answer within the timeout, calls raise `socket.timeout` instead of blocking forever. Raise it for long-running shell commands; `prompt_input` extends it internally to 130s to match the on-device prompt cap.

time.sleep(1)
device.touch(TOUCH_MOVE, 5, 400, 600)
time.sleep(1)
device.touch(TOUCH_UP, 5, 400, 600)
time.sleep(1)

# Multitouch
device.touch_with_list([
    {"type": TOUCH_DOWN, "finger_index": 1, "x": 300, "y": 300},
    {"type": TOUCH_DOWN, "finger_index": 2, "x": 500, "y": 500}

## Building From Source

Every push to `main` triggers a GitHub Actions build — Xcode compiles the app on a macOS runner, Theos builds the tweak, and both `.deb` files are uploaded as artifacts. **No Mac required.**

See [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml).
